                <h1>Underwater life is Wonderful!</h1>
                <p>Imagine a world never before seen by the human being. What kind of creatures would exist there? How would you know how to differentiate between the living and the inert? No, I'm not talking about a planet or a distant moon; I'm talking about the ocean - the marine biome.</p>
                <p>The marine biome is the largest on Earth. Although it covers 71% of our planet, we have only explored approximately 5% of its depths. Because of their large size, scientists estimate that more than half of species (or types of plants and animals) inhabit the ocean. Despite this, we are not sure how many species we speak as so many new species—more than half a million—have not yet been discovered. If we had a bowl full of candy, that would be like having even more than half to savor or discover.</p>
